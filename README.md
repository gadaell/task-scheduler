# Task Day Scheduler

# Purpose

A website that keeps track of your tasks and helps display the time lapse throughout the day once it passed that time frame.
Note: Gray means past time, Red means current time, Green means future time

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Challenges

- My biggest challenge was getting the information to store onto the website and pulling it back into that slot.

- Another issue was getting the time lapse to change color throughout the day.
